### Pursuation
- #### Persuasion 101
    Every person needs to know how to persuade. No better place to start than with Dr. Robert Cialdini who wrote Influence.

   > Originally published in 1984 this book became the bedrock of persuasion over the next 4 decades. Dr. Cialdini is a psychologist that wanted people to understand the tactics used against them. But quickly marketers, salespeople, and leaders in a wide range of fields took note. There are 7 ways people are influenced. In the original publication only 6 are covered. During the 2010s the book received an updated 7th as the world changed.

    What are the 7 ways? 
1. ##### Consistency
    
    People want to be consistent with what they have previously said or done. As a trial lawyer I used this principle in jury selection to get promises and then referenced it in closing argument. Or another way to say it "A man's got to have a code" (Omar) 
2. ##### Consensus
    
    People will conform when a large group hold a position. This can even be true when the person doesn't agree but fears speaking out against the group. You've probably seen or felt this at work.
    You've definitely seen or felt this in politics. 
3. ##### Similarity
    
    This is similar to consensus but different in that it's a specific shared attribute, background, or other trait. It's not about size like consensus but instead feeling a similar bond. "we are alike" is the persuasion tool used here. 
4. ##### Scarcity
    
    People want things when they know they can miss out. You've seen this with the rise of NFTs, cohort based courses, and even ebook sales on twitter. Plenty of other examples exist. A football stadium only has so many seats available for the big game.
    FOMO. 
5. ##### Reciprocity
    
    People will give back to someone that gave them something. Best example is if you have a child and you throw a birthday party you want other children to come. When those children's parents invite you to their bday party...you find all your weekends at them.
6. ##### Authority
    
    People want to follow the expert. Want to learn about Imposter Syndrome? Listen to Michelle Obama.
    It's why companies use athletes or other leaders to push their message. It's also why I gave the background on Dr. Cialdini at the very start. 
7. ##### Social Proof
    
    This one got added in the 2010s. It can be very similar to consensus or similarity. Except it's often people that are unknown to the person seeing the social proof. It helps people trust a person or product by seeing that others already do. 
    
    Many of these principles can be used together. You will start to see these everywhere. In ads, in speeches, in places you never expected. You will start to use them too. You should because persuasion is about delivering value to people.
